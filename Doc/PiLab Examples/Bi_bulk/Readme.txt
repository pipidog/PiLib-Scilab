This project calculate the band structure of cyrstalline Bi. 
This is a complicated 3D calculation test of PiLab. 
Their parameters and caluclation results can be found in 
PRB 520 1566 (1995). Besides, this system is also a nice
sample to test Z2 calculation. Reference can be found in 
JPSJ 76 053702.
